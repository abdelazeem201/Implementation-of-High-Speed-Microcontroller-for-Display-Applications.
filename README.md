# Implementation-of-High-Speed-Microcontroller-for-Display-Applications.
The System on Chip (SoC) prototyped in 180-nm CMOS occupies a chip area of 3.940 mm2 and dissipates 96.24uW from a 1.8 V supply at 100 MHz. Next, the design was synthesized with SMIC 180nm CMOS technology at Design Compiler platform, and the synthesis results show that the design fully met the design requirement. Subsequently, the design was physically implemented using the Place and Route flow, including the normal steps like Floorplanning, placement, optimization, clock tree synthesis (CTS) and routing. Finally, the design was verified by a series of verification and performance evaluation tests to guarantee its functionality and performance, using Encounter.
