# Implementation-of-High-Speed-Microcontroller-for-Display-Applications.

*#Abstract*
As intelligent cores for many dedicated application systems, microcontrollers found themselves embedded, performing different forms of display control and video applications.
Some of these systems are Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for industrial consoles, vending machines, automotive and marine dashboard clusters, household appliances, medical
devices and gaming machines. A key requirement for eficient controller design is efiective solution scaling as well as optimization for both cost and performance. The System on
Chip (SoC) prototyped in 180-nm CMOS occupies a chip area of 7.84 mm2 and dissipates 96.24uW from a 1.8 V supply at 100 MHz. Next, the design was synthesized with
SMIC 180nm CMOS technology at Design Compiler platform, and the synthesis results show that the design fully met the design requirement. Subsequently, the design was
physically implemented using the Place and Route flow, including the normal steps like Floorplanning, placement, optimization, clock tree synthesis (CTS) and routing. Finally,
the design was verified by a series of verification and performance evaluation tests to guarantee its functionality and performance, using Encounter.
